### Problem Statement
Traditional way of recruitment comes with the need to manually go through numerous applications to find out who suits the particular requirement of the job being offered. It can be time-consuming and expensive to manually analyze the personality traits of individuals. 

### Objective
- To explore multiple Natural Language Processing methods for extracting feature from text.
- To develop classification models for predicting personality types of an individual based on their online text. 
- To evaluate and compare the performance of the classification models for personality prediction.

### Dataset
- MBTI dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type)
- Contains 8675 rows of data
- Each row has two columns: Personal social networking posts from forum “PersonalityCafe.com”, MBTI personality type of the users

### Methodology
- Data pre-processing
- Natural language processing
- Supervised machine learning i.e. Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machine
- Performance evaluation
